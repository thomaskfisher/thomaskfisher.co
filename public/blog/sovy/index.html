        <h2 class="blog-header">What was it?</h2>
        <p>
            Sovy was the madeup name of a project I worked on during my junior year of undergrad and into my first internship with Tesla.
            Ben, a friend of mine who was in his second and final year of the graduate program, had the idea of giving people the hands-on opportunity to safely experience online phishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you aren't familiar, phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information or to deploy malicious software on the victim's computer.
            A common example of phishing are fake emails that look like they came from Amazon notifying you that an order you never placed has been shipped. Conveniently there's a way to dispute the charge, and if you click on it you're taken to a login page that looks near-identical to Amazon's login page. If you enter your Amazon credentials you've just revealed sensitive information to a malicious person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ben wanted to create a service that would send customers phishing emails to give them real-world exposure to what they looked like and how to spot them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-header">Why did we build it?</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing, and phishing emails specifically, can be very difficult to detect.
            All of us that worked on Sovy were in the undergrad or graduate Information Systems programs at BYU, and even some of us had fallen for phishing scams.
            We were aware that some companies sent phishing emails to their own employees in an attempt to give them practice recognizing malicious emails. We wanted to offer the same kind of training/hands-on experirence to anyone.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-header">What did it do?</h2>
        <h4>Random Phishing Emails</h4>
        <p>
            The idea was simple, when you signed up for the Sovy service you would start to receive phishing emails.
            You might get 3 emails one week, and no emails the next. You would receive emails at random intervals and they would always be disguised as if they were from someone other than Sovy.
            Some of the emails were generic phishing attempts, below are a coupe of examples.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail blog-image" src="Generic.png">
        </div>
        <p class="image-description">Two separate examples of generic phishing emails we created.</p>
        <p>
            Other phishing emails were much more targeted. They used the names and logos of well known brands that many people would be familiar with and likely use.
            For these targeted phishing emails we would also recreate the login forms, so that if a user clicked on a link they'd be taken to a legitimate looking login page.
            This gave users even more exposure and practice. These login forms weren't actually capturing any user information, and as soon as they clicked submit or login they'd be taken to the Sovy website.
            Here are two examples of the more tailored phisihing attempts.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail blog-image" src="Facebook.png">
        </div>
        <p class="image-description">A phishing email that looks like it came from Facebook</p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail blog-image" src="Yahoo.png">
        </div>
        <p class="image-description">A fake login page that a user would be redirected to if they clicked on a link in our Yahoo phishing email.</p>
        <p>
            Each phishing email could track if it had been opened and if any links had been clicked.
            We would give you a passing grade if the email was never opened, or if the email was opened but no links were clicked within a specific period of time after it had been sent.
            Once the test was over and it was determined that you had passed, we would send a follow up email.
            The follow up would include a screenshot of the phishing email and gave a summary of the various ways you could've determined it was phishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you received a phishing email from us and you did click on a link you would be redirected to the Sovy website.
            On our site we had explanations for how you could spot the red flags for each of our phishing emails.
            We also had more general educational information on phishing and miscellanrous online securty.
            If you failed one of our phishing tests you would receive the same email again sometime in the future.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="blog-header">How did it go?</h2>
        <p>
            Sovy never really made it off the ground. The group of students that were working on it were all graduate students aside from me, and when they graduated it was quickly forgotten.
            Ben and I continued for a while after. I worked on the website and our phishing emails while Ben worked on business plans/pricing/sales/etc.
            We did get a few paying customers for a month or two, and maybe made $50 or so. But as my Tesla internship progressed I had less time, and Ben was starting his first job out of school.
            There were a lot of ideas we wanted to implement but never got to such as customer phishing scores, partnerships with companies, and expanding into other online security areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was my first real experience writingn code out of school.
            I learned a lot from the grad students that helped in the beggining, both technical and how to work with a team remotely.
            In the end nothing really came out of this project, but even to this day I think it's a great idea and could help a lot of people learn.
            Who knows, maybe one day I'll start working on it again and phishing emails will become a thing of the past.
