                                                    and determination is what comes to mind when I think about Thomas. I
                                                    had the
                                                    pleasure of working with Thomas on a large scale project that
                                                    included many stakeholders. Thomas
                                                    expertly stepped into this project position and "took the bull by
                                                    the horns" when no one else
                                                    did. He took a project that should have taken months to complete,
                                                    across in the finish line in a
                                                    matter of weeks. His ability to engage multiple stakeholders was
                                                    what contributed to such a
                                                    successful product launch. Anyone would be lucky to have Thomas be a
                                                    part of their company and

                                                    hidden project requirements.
                                                    He is a self starter who gets stuff done. Overall I highly recommend

                                                    generation issue, and you could always count on him to point you in
                                                    the right direction even if
                                                    he didn't have the answer. Thomas was friendly and a pleasure to
                                                    work with, and helped me
                                                    succeed in my current position today. I would highly recommend him
                                                    to any team who is looking
                                                    for someone with dedication and integrity.</p>

                                                    come across a talent like Thomas. I had the pleasure of working with
                                                    Thomas
                                                    at Tesla on a critical project with tight timeline. I was
                                                    particularly impressed with Thomas’s
                                                    ability to handle high pressure time bound project with many
                                                    unknowns. When I met him initially
                                                    I thought he was an experienced employee, but when I learned he is
                                                    an intern, I was totally
                                                    blown away. What stood out for me is his passion, amazing work
                                                    ethics, and thoroughness in his
                                                    work. Its delightful to see how he takes ownership seriously and
                                                    delivers on his
                                                    responsibilities. When the time came for him to leave Tesla as he
                                                    was completing his internship,
                                                    there were many of us wishing he would stay behind as we all miss
                                                    him very much at Tesla. Thomas
                                                    would be an asset to any team he joins but hoping he’ll opt to come
                                                    back to Tesla when he is
                                                    done with his education.</p>

                                                    during his Fall internship. We gave him a messy, expansive CRM data

                                                    about Tesla. I’d be more

                                                    things incredibly quick
                                                    with little direction. Technical documentation, prototyping, data
                                                    and analytics, user
                                                    story
                                                    creation, mentoring new hires, and much more -- Thomas did it all. I
                                                    could always count
                                                    on
                                                    Thomas to do nothing less than the highest quality of work. In
                                                    addition to his excellent
                                                    work ethic, Thomas' positive attitude made the work environment that
                                                    much better.</p>
