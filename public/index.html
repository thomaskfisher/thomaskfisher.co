                    <p class="text-faded">Hi! My name is Thomas Fisher.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">I have a Master's Degree in Information Systems Management and experience in
                        technical project/product management, developing web applications, and turning side projects
                        into businesses (with varying levels of success).</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems, whether that be improving 
                        business processes or just building something to make my life easier. I enjoy coding when I need to
                        but understanding a problem well enough to design a solution is what I love to do.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">In my free time I code, play soccer, go off-roading, help out at my
                        family's cattle ranch, boat at Bear Lake, golf poorly, and work on old cars.</p>

                        blown away. What stood out for me is his passion, amazing work ethics, and thoroughness in his
                        work. Its delightful to see how he takes ownership seriously and delivers on his
                        responsibilities. When the time came for him to leave Tesla as he was completing his internship,
                        there were many of us wishing he would stay behind as we all miss him very much at Tesla. Thomas
                        would be an asset to any team he joins but hoping he’ll opt to come back to Tesla when he is

                                "Thomas did an excellent job leading myself and several other interns through a
                                multi-step
                                urgent project.

                                In addition to staying late for multiple days on his own initiative, he displayed a
                                strong
                                focus throughout the time-sensitive project of validating sensitive data as soon as
                                possible. He promptly contacted all parties involved in the project when required,
                                maintained the pace of uploading validated information, and oversaw the revision of our
                                online database following the data validation.

                                When others were slower or less efficient with these tasks, he chose to reallocate more
                                of
                                the customers to himself and completed a larger share of the work in order to finish the
                                project as soon as the team possibly could. In addition he distributed the workload
                                across
                                the team in accordance with each individuals strengths and other urgent projects,
                                efficiently delegating rather than handle the entire workload himself. He exhibited many
                                traits of an effective project manager primarily through leading by example, and far
                                exceeded the minimum level of effort required."

                                of 6
                                to execute database changes and integrate various applications, ensuring we had the most
                                accurate and relevant data available to properly place business school students and
                                graduates. He used his skills to master several programming-based environments and
                                incorporated the use of Sprints in pushing the team forward. Thomas asks the right
                                questions
                                and appropriately challenges the purposes for collecting data and pressing forward with

                                particular process. He wants the results to influence the decisions, not just to inform,
                                but
                                to foster change or deliver key solutions. He created and briefed Tableau solutions at

                                University level that continue to serve as models for others to replicate. Thomas is a
                                delight to work with, unafraid to tackle the task, and extremely well-organized. In my
                                opinion, he is serious-minded and detail-oriented, yet he understands how to open up to
                                others and enthusiastically communicate with them. He simply enjoys contributing to and
