                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p class="left-align light">I graduated High School in 2013, and since then I have spent the last few years at Brigham Young University working towards an undergraduate degree in Information Systems (IS) and a Computer Science (CS) Minor. I plan on starting the Masters of Information Systems Management program in the fall of 2017. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">I'm currently in the IS Junior Core, and so far I've really enjoyed the curriculum, professors, and culture of the program. The core classes that I have completed so far are Systems Analysis, Database Systems, Business Programming, and Business Processes and Controls. In addition to those core classes, I also completed Spreadsheets for Business Analysis, a masters level class. The second semester of the core includes Data Communications, Project Management, System Design and Implementation, and Enterprise Application Development. I list all of these courses because that is the best way to illustrate how diverse and well-rounded the Information Systems program is. Not only am I learning how to develop software, but I'm also learning how to become a project manager, security analyst, databse administrator, and more! I cannot say enough good things about this program, and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity I have to be a part of it. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">I'm halfway through my CS minor, with my most recent courses being Discrete Mathematics and Data Structures. I've been taking CS classes since my freshman year, and have always enjoyed the more technical mindset required by CS. I plan to continue the minor throughout the rest of this year and into my masters program. The next Computer Science courses I plan on taking are advanced programming concepts and web programming. I'm excited to gain a deeper understanding of the advanced techncial side of CS, as well as to learn more web development skills from a CS perspective in addition to the IS persepective I already have experience with.</p>

                    <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p class="left-align light">I've had many jobs over the years and I've learned from each, but my current job as a Career Specialist/Data Analyst/Developer at the Business Career Center in the Marriott School of Management has allowed me to grow, learn, and has given me such invaluable experience that I almost always refer to it when I'm asked behavioral interview questions.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">When I was first hired, it was for their Information Career Specialist role. That consists of answering student questions about internships and jobs, researching companies and their cultures, finding useful external resources to be used when helping with a students' job search, and networking with alumni and recruiters to help get every student in the program an internship of full-time job.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Working solely as a Career Specialist didn't last long. Within a month of starting work, my entire team (which consisted mostly of graduate students) left for their summer internships leaving me to run the day-to-day operations. The biggest project that was passed to me was the development and maintenence of our Tableau dashboards. In the weeks before everyone left, they created and published 8 analytics dashboards to unify the Business Career Centers' data reporting efforts. Tableau was a new tool to the Career Center and it was met with excitement, however, there were many problems with accuracy of the dashboards and most users needed training on how to use it and had a list of changes they wanted made to the dashboards. So for the next 4 months I dove into Tableau and learned how to use and create Tableau dashboards (since I had never heard of it before this job). I also maintained and imporoved the existing dashboards, created new dashboards based on user feedback, and created a system and user documentation to allow new users or employees to quickly become familiar with Tableau.</p>

                    <br><br><br>
                    <p class="left-align light">Currently, I still have all of the responsibilites mentioned above. I still meet with and advise students, and I help maintain and create Tableau dashboards, but as my coworkers are graduating I've begun taking on a more development and project management focused role. I'm now one of the senior employees which has allowed me to hire new student employees and manage them as they complete day-to-day taks while I focus on the bigger projects.</p>
                    <p class="left-align light">Like I said before, this job has allowed me to grow and learn more than I ever could have imagined. With everyday comes new challenges, and I am grateful for the trust given to me and my team.</p>

It is a week long event meant to give us a taste of what kind of work we might be doing in industry. It required us to use the skills and knowledge we had learned in all of our classes over that semester. We were given a business case where we were to act as a consulting firm tasked with proposing a new system for a worldwide pharmaceutical company that performed lab assays. My team and I spent the week writing a proposal and building a prototype that adopted Amazon Web Services to run a web-based system. </p>
                    <p class="left-align light">In my Discrete Mathematics course, our semester-long project was to build a relational database using C++ and the skills we learned over the semester, such as lexical analysis and relational algebra. It was built incrementally with the intention of being maintainable and extendable into the future. By the end of the semester I had built, from scratch, a program capable of reading in text files with data and then answering queries based on that data.</p>
