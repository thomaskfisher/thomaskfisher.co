            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h5>Definition</h5>
            <p class="left-align light">If you Google Bitcoin and take the time to sift through all the articles, you'll see words like "peer-to-peer" and "cryptocurrency." If that's what you want then you're in the wrong place, but if you need a simplified version and want my opinion on Bitcoin then here is my definition. Bitcoin is like using cash on the internet. The problem with that definition is that people often relate Bitcon to using a credit card online. Bitcoin is NOT like a credit card! Bitcoin is it's own currency unlike a credit card that simply stores or represents the U.S. Dollar. You can convert your Dollar to Bitcoin, and that's done like converting Dollars to Euro's when you go do a study abroad in Italy. But when you convert your dollars to Bitcoin you won't ever get to hold your Bitcon because it's a digital currency.</p>
            <h5>How do I get Bitcoin?</h5>
            <p class="left-align light">There are two ways, you can either mine the Bitcoin (as explained above) or you can purchase it. When you purchase Bitcoin you're exchanging your dollars for the equivalent value in Bitcoin, the same as foreign currency. You can purchase Bitcoin from a variety of places, but the easiest would be through an online service.</p>
                <h5>How/Where do I store my Bitcoin?</h5>
                <p class="left-align light">Because it's digital, Bitcoin can be stored on the hardrive of you laptop. Crazy right? But for the causal user you probably wouldn't want to store it there because it would be hard to access it and use it to pay for stuff. Have you ever used a cloud storage system like iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Onedrive, etc? The benefit of using a software like one of those is that you can have your documents and pictures wherever you go right? So now you take a picture on your phone and within thirty seconds it's on your tablet and laptop. Well if you're going to be using Bitcoin to pay for you lunch everyday you'll probably want to store your Bitcoin in the cloud so you can access it on the go (just like your pictures). Don't use Dropbox to store you Bitcoin though. There is software and apps built specifically to store your Bitcoin securely and at the same time allow you to use your Bitcoin day to day.</p>
                <h5>How do I use Bitcoin to buy something?</h5>
                <p class="left-align light">There are multiple ways to use Bitcoin to buy stuff. The most user friendly is a mobile wallet such as the app 'Coinbase.' With a mobile wallet you can simply send or request Bitcoin. Not a lot of stores accept Bitcoin yet, but acceptence is definitely growing. </p>
            <h5>How is Bitcon made?</h5>
            <p class="left-align light">How does digital currency work? Where does it come from? Let's compare this to the money system that we already understand. Where do Dollars come from? Well the government decides when to print more money. Is there a problem with that? Yes there is. There is no limit to how much money Obama (or any other president) can print, and so as they print more Dollars each Dollar becomes less valuable. This is inflation. So where does this digital currency come from? Do you want the easy or the complicated answer? The easy answer is that they come out of thin air. Because they're digital they don't need anything other than a computer to make them. So I guess the better answer is a computer makes them, or rather a lot of computers make a lot of Bitcoins. Do you see a problem with that? So anyone with a computer can make this digital currency that can be converted to actual U.S. Dollars? Yes actually, but it isn't as simple as it sounds. The creation of new Bitcoin is called mining. Bitcoin mining is using a computer to solve incredibly complex math problems, and when you solve it you are awarded with brand new Bitcoin. Sounds easy right? Well don't get too excited to make quick and easy money by mining Bitcoin because you need special hardware that is built just for mining. You average Macbook couldn't handle the processing power required. Well that's not true, it could probably solve one math problem if it ran 24/7 for a few years.
                <p class="left-align light">There are thousands of computers right now working together all over the world mining Bitcoin. In fact the combined processing power of mining machines is greater than the top 500 supercomputers combined (I read that somewhere). If you've been paying attention you should be wondering if inflation is a problem with Bitcoin since people are always mining for more. It would be if it not for the fact that the total amount is a finite number set at 21 million Bitcoins. The creators of Bitcoin knew that inflation could be stopped if there wasn't an unlimited number. So they set the 21 million limit, and additionally they set rules that make the mining math problems increasingly difficult as more Bitcoin are mined. Currently there are around 12 million Bitcoin already mined, and at the rate we're going it won't be until the year 2140 that all Bitcoin will be mined and in circulation.</p>
            <h5>Who owns/controls Bitcoin?</h5>
                <p class="left-align light">Bitcoin is’t owned by anyone, it's like email. Everyone can use it, but there isn’t a bank or company or government that regulates or controls it. Just like cash, when you use Bitcoin in a purchase that transaction is irreversible. That means that no one (no bank or government) can stop you from sending or receiving Bitcoins with anyone else, anywhere in the world.</p>
                <h5>If no one owns Bitcoin who invented it?</h5>
                <p class="left-align light">No one knows. The creator of Bitcoin goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, but for unknown reasons his real identity is unkown. There are a few possible creators but we may never know. Why would the creator want to keep his or herself anonymous? Probably because they are already incredibly wealthy and/or famous and don't feel the need to either one of those categories.</p>                
                <h5>Bitcoin volitility</h5>
                <p class="left-align light">This is probably the biggest problem with Bitcoin. Because it has a relatively small user-base, and the fact that it isn't backed by any other currency Bitcoin can be quite volitile (aka the worth of one Bitcoin can drastically change throughout short periods of time). As the creation of Bitcoin stablizes, the number of worldwide users increase, and the idea of decentralized currency becomes more popular Bitcoin values will stabalize.</p>
