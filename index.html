                    <p class="text-faded">Hi! My name is Thomas Fisher and I'm a graduate student at Brigham Young University studying Information Systems and Computer Science.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Big dreams have always come naturally to me, and I firmly believe that you can't get anywhere in life without hard work. Whether it was learning to play an instrument twice my size in elementary school (the Upright Bass), fixing a fifty-year-old truck with absolutely no experience, or teaching myself HTML in between shifts and class during high school, I work hard to accomplish my goals. My outlook on life is this, anything is possible if you're passionate, dedicate the necessary time, and work until the only possible outcome is success.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">In my free time, I play the upright Bass, most recently in the BYU University String Orchestra and the BYU Jazz Lab Ensemble. I have played soccer since I was young, and since moving to BYU I've been playing intramural soccer on and off. I also love learning about and working on old cars. My first car was a 1964 Ford F-250 that I bought from my grandfather (the original owner), and my current baby is a 1973 Jeep CJ-5 I hope to eventually turn into a Moab-worthy rock crawler.</p>

He quickly integrated with the Commerce team and truly became a key player in keeping everything moving forward. What impressed me most about Thomas was his ability to learn new things incredibly quick with little direction. Technical documentation, prototyping, data and analytics, user story creation, mentoring new hires, and much more -- Thomas did it all. I could always count on Thomas to do nothing less than the highest quality of work. In addition to his excellent work ethic, Thomas' positive attitude made the work environment that much better."

Documentation was not a priority with those elbows deep in setting up the new environment. Thomas was there to ask the right questions, keep track of everything, and provide a level head during a hectic time. We came out of this time with a successful implementation AND the documentation of what was done and instructions of the steps we took to get us there. I will miss his disciplined mind and cheerful disposition. I wish him the best in his future endeavors."

He worked well with cross functional teams making sure tasks were completed to meet project deadlines. His positive can do attitude makes him a great team player. Thomas’s experience at Tesla taught him to look at the whole picture when finding a solution for the company which will make him an asset to any company.

In addition to staying late for multiple days on his own initiative, he displayed a strong focus throughout the time-sensitive project of validating sensitive data as soon as possible. He promptly contacted all parties involved in the project when required, maintained the pace of uploading validated information, and oversaw the revision of our online database following the data validation.

When others were slower or less efficient with these tasks, he chose to reallocate more of the customers to himself and completed a larger share of the work in order to finish the project as soon as the team possibly could. In addition he distributed the workload across the team in accordance with each individuals strengths and other urgent projects, efficiently delegating rather than handle the entire workload himself. He exhibited many traits of an effective project manager primarily through leading by example, and far exceeded the minimum level of effort required."

I trusted him to direct a team of 6 to execute database changes and integrate various applications, ensuring we had the most accurate and relevant data available to properly place business school students and graduates. He used his skills to master several programming-based environments and incorporated the use of Sprints in pushing the team forward. Thomas asks the right questions and appropriately challenges the purposes for collecting data and pressing forward with a particular process.  He wants the results to influence the decisions, not just to inform, but to foster change or deliver key solutions.  He created and briefed Tableau solutions at the University level that continue to serve as models for others to replicate. Thomas is a delight to work with, unafraid to tackle the task, and extremely well-organized.  In my opinion, he is serious-minded and detail-oriented, yet he understands how to open up to others and enthusiastically communicate with them.  He simply enjoys contributing to and working on teams."</p>
